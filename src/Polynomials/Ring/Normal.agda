--   z≤n : ∀ {n}                 → zero  ≤ n
--   s≤s : ∀ {m n} (m≤n : m ≤ n) → suc m ≤ suc n
--
-- This follows the structure of its first argument. In other words:
--
--   n ≤ m ≅ fold s≤s z≤n n
--
-- This isn't good, as that first argument is the length of the *rest*
-- of the list:
--
--   [(⋯ , 5 ≤ 6) , (4 ≤ 5), (3 ≤ 4), (1 ≤ 3), (0 ≤ 1)]
--
-- Meaning that consuming it the normal way will be quadratic.
--
-- 2.

--   constructor less-than-or-equal
--   field
--     {k}   : ℕ
--     proof : m + k ≡ n
--
-- Also not advantageuos. While it does store the k (which is the
-- size of the gap, which is what we need to use to get linear
-- performance), it doesn't provide any inductive structure, so
-- computations on the k don't provide evidence about the m or n.
-- That said, it works by storing an equality proof, so we could just
-- aggresively erase it, but it's messy (and perhaps unsound).
--
-- 3.

--   ≤′-step : ∀ {n} (m≤′n : m ≤′ n) → m ≤′ suc n
--
-- This structure works best. It effectively inducts on the k in 2.,
